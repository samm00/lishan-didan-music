Chorus: I am a stone flower, I am a stone flower
what to say for my longing heart
like the sun
if you don't shine on me
I am cold and colorless
 
I am a stone flower
what to say from my longing heart
like sun
if you don't shine on me
I am cold and colorless
 
I'm all sighs and all pain
like a cyclone, spin around you
I'm all sighs and all pain
like a cyclone, spin around you
a drunken wind in the desert
lost and going in circles around you
 
Chorus
 
If like rain, you don't fall on me
you won't know how I'm doing
I will wither in a few days
then your stone heart will be longing for me
I am a stone flower
what to say from my longing heart
 
Chorus
 
If like rain, you don't fall on me
you won't know how I'm doing
I will wither in a few days
then your stone heart will be longing for me
I am a stone flower
what to say from my longing heart
 
Chorus
